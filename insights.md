1. **Campaign Performance**
   - Spring Sale (Email) brought in the highest revenue.
   - Social campaigns had lower average revenue per order.

   - Repeat customers (Alice) contribute significantly to revenue.

3. **Product Trends**
   - Laptops (Electronics) generate the highest revenue.
   - Fashion items (Shoes, T-Shirt) drive volume but lower revenue.
